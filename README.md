This is an Android app built in Android Studio to store and manage recipes. It was coded in Java.

The app allows users to create recipes, and the steps to complete them, then store them. Users can check off various steps as they complete them. There are a number of interactive tools the user can include, such as timers and lists. After completing a recipe, users can store it as a favorite and access it again in the future.

The app itself is fully functional and has been tested on my Android virtual machine.
